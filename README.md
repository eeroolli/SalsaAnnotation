# SalsaApp

In this project we will create annotations/labels for cuban salsa videos. Salsa is a couple dance where movement patterns appear in counting of 4 steps.
The elementary unit of movement (word) is assigned to one of these steps, while figures (sentences) correspond to a sequential arrangement of one or more 4 steps counting. 

Information of the dancing couple in the videos can be simplied by capturing the key points with Openpose. 

Supervised learning:
 * Features are:
 * Labels are:

With this structure of words and sentences the problem could be tackled with NLP tools. Learning the embedding of a sentence. 

We expect 2 main outputs:

1. Given a video: obtain the annotations at different levels (words or sentences)
1. Given a seed movement: generate words or sentences that can continue the dance in autonomus way
